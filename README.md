## Overview
In general terms, glossary is defined as a list of terms in a special domain or area of usage, with accompanying definitions. In the translation context, glossary can be defined as a pair which is associated with a field of knowledge, source being in one language and the target being in another language.

Ex : `{Appellant, अपीलकर्ता}` can be a pair under the en-hi glossary for the judicial domain. 

Such glossary helps the Translation/Annotations systems to make effective translation based on the context and domain.

## Frontend
The UI for the explorer is kept simple. We can search for a particular glossary term by providing a language (mandatory) and domain (optional).
